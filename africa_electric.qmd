<h3> Background </h3>
<p> In the Winter of 2023 I was enrolled in a course at UCSB about energy and the environment. I contacted the professor about working in their lab on campus, called the Clean Energy Transformation Lab (CETlab). I was brought in to do some data visualization work on an <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S254243512200304X">existing research paper</a> about enabling a low-carbon electricity system for Southern Africa. More specifically, I was tasked with refactoring plot generation code into Python, along with presenting these newly generated plots on the lab's website. I designed an  website was developed in python primarily using <a href="https://dash.plotly.com/"> dash plotly</a>.
