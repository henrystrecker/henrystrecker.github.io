### Background
In the Fall of 2022 I took a course about water supply and demand, and decided to explore the concept of nitrate pollution as a  project for the honors program. What came out of it was this dashboard that details nitrate pollution in groundwater wells throughout California. This data come from the United States Geological Survey, and was last updated in October 2022. The website was developed in python primarily using <a href="https://dash.plotly.com/"> dash plotly</a>.
